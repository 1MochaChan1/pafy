# Media Player for youtube

To use this in Unix based systems make sure remove some of the modules that are used for windows from the requirements.txt

Also this requires VLC Media Player to be installed to run properly

If you want to try this out I would recomment installing the development version of KivyMD from here :
https://pypi.org/project/kivymd/

Or use these commands :

git clone https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD.git --depth 1

cd KivyMD

pip install .

yt_mod_1.py is a custom module I created for scraping youtube for it's search results
